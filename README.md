# Modular Python Trading Bot

A reproducible, production-ready Python bot that trades U.S. equities/ETFs using a combined momentum + mean-reversion core, optional ML overlay, and robust risk controls.

## Project Structure

This project follows the structure defined in `tradingbot.yml` with organized modules for data ingestion, feature engineering, strategy development, risk management, backtesting, and live execution.

## Getting Started

Documentation and setup instructions will be added as the project develops through the sprint phases.
